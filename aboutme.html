    <h1>All about me!</h1>
    <p>"Hello everyone! My name is Brady Chyla and I am a junior at Waukesha West High School.</p>

    <p>This is a picture of me at the State Marching Band Competition last year. As you can see I am not very happy because the rain caused all of our electronics to go out. Fortunately, though, we still took first place and were State champions!</p>
    <p>Other extracurriculars that I am involved in are Academic Decathlon and FBLA. Also, I play basketball in a CYM league with a bunch of my friends.</p>

    <p>If you click on the basketball, you can see our league's standings from last year. Our team (Waukesha Catholic - Mrochinski) took second place in our division and made it to the Final 4 in the league-wide tournament!</p>

    <p style="color:rainbow">Time for some color:</p>
    <p style="color:green;">My favorite color is green.</p> 
    <p style="color:darkblue">However, I also like blue.</p>
